# 🔥 Algerian Forest Fire Prediction (Regression Project)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a **Machine Learning Regression-based Web Application** that predicts forest fire risk using environmental and meteorological factors from the **Algerian Forest Fires Dataset**.

A trained **Ridge Regression model** is deployed using **Flask**, allowing users to input parameters via a web interface and receive predictions in real time.
